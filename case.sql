In the FBIâ€™s Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program,

Violent crimes are defined in the UCR Program

/*In terms of violent crime in general, b2 seems to have the most, with B11 and B3 
following close behind, hence these areas probably are more crime prone (but I should
look at how big these areas are, because maybe B2,B3, and C11 just cover more area)
*/

/*Looking at the KML file in Google earth (I really didn't have time to install any
GIS programs and remember how to use them at this time, though I have used multiple
GIS programs in the past, just not recently), B2 covers Roxbury/Mission Hill, C11 Covers
Dorchester, and B3 Covers Mattapan areas, all areas where if you read the news, there 
are more shootings.  Interseting though D4 covers Back Bay and the South End, where one
does not hear about shootings in the news that often in those neighborhoods.
